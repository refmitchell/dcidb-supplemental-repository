All behavioural data presented in the paper (and used for modelling)
are included here.

These can be read using any tool which is capable of reading csv
files (e.g. excel, or python via pandas).

[cue_weight_data.csv]
This contains the main cue conflict data presented in Figure 2. Column
headers are in the format wind_speed-light_elevation-conflict, so
2.50-45-060 would be 2.5m/s wind speed, 45 degree elevation, and 60
degree cue conflict.

[data_sixty.csv]
This contains the data from the three day experiment where we
repeatedly tested 60 degree elevations and 2.5m/s wind speeds to
examine behaviour where cue reliabilities were near equal.

[changes_full.csv]
The previous two files combined into one for model evaluation purposes
(as models had to account for all observed cue conflict data).

[elevation_rvals.csv]
Beetle precision at different elevations. Used for Figure 1.

[wind_rvals.csv]
Beetle precision at different wind speeds. Used for Figure 1.

[wind_heatmap_data.csv]
The data used to construct the wind heatmaps in the supplementary
information.
